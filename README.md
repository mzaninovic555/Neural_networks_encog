# Neural networks
Exercise projects for an unconventional algorithms course in neural networks.
The first project involves splitting words from different language, but same meaning, into different components that are similar to eachother. They are then fed into the neural network as inputs, and the output is which word it is in Croatian.
The second project is about image recognition and numbers. The neural network learns with several fonts with a fixed resolution. Then a full 11 digit phone number is fed into the program, which image is cut into 11 pieces using a custom function. The neural network outputs the result for each of those 11 images, and the end result should be the full phone number that was fed in the network in the first place.
